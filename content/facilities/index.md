        Our laboratory is designed to undertake chemical and isotopic analyses in liquid samples. Instruments include:
        - Dual water isotope analysers (Picarro L2120-i and LGR DT-100)
        - Triple water isotope analyser (Picarro L2140-i)
        - Carbon isotope analyser (Picarro)
        - Radon detector (Durridge RAD7)
        - Ion chromatograph (Dionex ICS 5000)
        - UV-Vis spectrophotometer (TBC)
        - Spectrofluorometer (TBC)
        - Autosamplers and field sensors
        - Other basic equipment (ovens, incubator, etc)
        
        The group has also access to additional facilities within the School of Chemistry
