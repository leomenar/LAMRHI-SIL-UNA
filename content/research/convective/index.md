Current changes in climate patterns challenge water resources management in Costa Rica. Although the country is considered rich regarding water availability, extreme climate events such as enhanced convective activity, tropical cyclones and extended periods of droughts could result in water stress impacting socio-economic activity. In this project, we aim to better understand how convective/extreme precipitation events impact surface and groundwater resources in tropical regions. We will be implementing a high frequency temporal sampling network of precipitation and groundwater in the northern region of the Central Valley of Costa Rica. Our goal is to provide novel insights into the interpretation of hydrological tracers in the tropics under current climate change.
